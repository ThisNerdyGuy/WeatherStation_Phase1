WeatherStation_Phase1
=====================
This code is the compilation of all the code provided for by SparkFun for their sensors. 

The sensors used in Phase 1 are: 
- TEMT6000 Analog Ambient Light Sensor
- HIH4030  Analog Humidity Sensor
- TMP102   Digital Temperature Sensor
- BMP085   Digital Barometric Pressure Sensor

This code is fully functional as-is. 

Since this was my first go-round with an Arduino project, all this code does is read (or calculate) the input of the 
sensors and directly output via Serial.print().
